## Citi Bike Analysis
This is an analysis of citi bike data from the New York Citi Bike program. This analysis is lookig at ride data throughout the month of June in 2013. 

## Tableau Visualization
In this Tableau workbook you will find a number of visualizations including a Tableau story combining all visualizations and findings

### Dashboards of the stations locations and gender analysis of members:

## Trends
When analyzing the station data and map visualizations, you will notice the popularity of the stations by the larger circles. The more times a rider starts and ends at a given station, the higher the count, and the larger the circle. You will see that for both ride and start, many of the larger circles are the same on both maps. A station like W. 20th St. & 11th Ave. is one of the larger circles on both maps. There are also more larger circles on the outter areas of the city than in the middle of the city. This could be due to location of other nearby stations in relation to population. In addition, riders on the outter areas of the city may have less access to other forms of transportation and choose to use the city bikes instead. 

## Interesting Data 
One interesting discovery I found was rider behavior depending on the time of the month. In the first half of the month, but customers and subscribers took longer trips on average. In the second half of the month the number of rides taken was higher for consumers and subscribers. The number of rides taken by subscribers was drastically higher in the second half of the month. This could be that subscribers felt like they wanted to get their money's worth for their subscription.  riders took longer trips on average. In the second half of the month the number of rides was 

Another interesting data discovery I found was subscription bike usage based on the gender. Referencing the gender dashboard, you can see that women on average take longer rides than men. However there are more male subscribers than female subscribers, as shown in the pie chart. The red references unknown gender. Men however have taken more rides than females. It is interesting to see how this influences the data set and analysis.

## Recommendations
If city officials are looking for ways to increase membership and ride usage, they can look at the popular stations and can advertise deals for becoming a subscriber. In addition, they can do additional marketing and advertising based on target audience and gender. For females they can create a storyline around the benefits of long leisure rides that may resonate with that audience. With men, they can market the advantages of having accessible transportation to get them from A to B. 

## What I would do differently
For future analysis into the data set there are additional areas I would like to dive deeper. I would be interested to understand how gender influences the number of rides taken at the beginning and end of the month. I would also like to better understand how age impacts the dataset, gender, and overall ride usage. I did not have an opportunity to explore deeply into the bike utilization. Bikeid 15259 was used almost twice as much as any other bike. I would be curious to understand where that bike was located, what stations it frequently traveled between, and why it may have received so much usage.
