## Interactive Dashboard

[Module 18 - Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mustafa.ayter/viz/module18-tableau)

## Highlights
- When examining station data and maps, we notice that popular stations have larger circles. These circles represent frequent starting and ending points for riders.
- Many of these popular stations are consistent for both ride starts and ride ends.
- Stations located in the outer areas of the city tend to have larger circles, possibly due to population distribution and limited alternative transportation options.

## Spotlights
- Rider behavior varies based on the time of the month: in the first half of the month, both customers and subscribers take longer trips on average, in the second half of the month, the number of rides increases, especially for subscribers.
- Subscribers may be motivated to maximize their subscription value.
- Gender influences bike usage: women, on average, take longer rides than men.
- Although there are more male subscribers, womenâ€™s ride lengths stand out. This gender difference impacts the overall dataset.

## Recommendations
To boost membership and ride usage, city can:
- Promote deals for becoming a subscriber, focusing on popular stations.
- Tailor marketing efforts based on target audience and gender.
- Highlight leisure benefits for female riders and accessibility advantages for men.

## Future work
- Investigate how gender affects ride frequency at the start and end of the month.
- Explore age-related impacts on dataset trends.
- Examine bike utilization further, especially the bike with ID 15259, which stands out in terms of usage.


## Citi Bike Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Citi Bike ridership data using Tableau to uncover insights about user behavior, popular stations, and usage patterns. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for improving the bike-sharing service.

## Key Findings
Popular stations are consistent for both ride starts and ends, with larger circles on maps indicating higher usage.
Outer city areas show higher station usage, possibly due to limited transportation alternatives.
Rider behavior varies throughout the month, with longer rides in the first half and increased ride frequency in the second half.
Gender influences ride patterns, with women taking longer rides on average.
