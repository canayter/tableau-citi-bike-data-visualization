## Interactive Dashboard

[Citi Bike Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mustafa.ayter/viz/module18-tableau)

## Highlights
- When examining station data and maps, we notice that popular stations have larger circles. These circles represent frequent starting and ending points for riders.
- Many of these popular stations are consistent for both ride starts and ride ends.
- Stations located in the outer areas of the city tend to have larger circles, possibly due to population distribution and limited alternative transportation options.

## Spotlights
- Rider behavior varies based on the time of the month: in the first half of the month, both customers and subscribers take longer trips on average, in the second half of the month, the number of rides increases, especially for subscribers.
- Subscribers may be motivated to maximize their subscription value.
- Gender influences bike usage: women, on average, take longer rides than men.
- Although there are more male subscribers, womenâ€™s ride lengths stand out. This gender difference impacts the overall dataset.

## Recommendations
To boost membership and ride usage, city can:
- Promote deals for becoming a subscriber, focusing on popular stations.
- Tailor marketing efforts based on target audience and gender.
- Highlight leisure benefits for female riders and accessibility advantages for men.

## Future work
- Investigate how gender affects ride frequency at the start and end of the month.
- Explore age-related impacts on dataset trends.
- Examine bike utilization further, especially the bike with ID 15259, which stands out in terms of usage.
